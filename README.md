# BookScraper

I created a web scraper with Python, leveraging the requests library to retrieve HTML content and BeautifulSoup to parse and extract information. I utilized pandas to structure the scraped data into a DataFrame. My scraper extracts the first 5 pages of BooksToScrape.com, pulling each book's title, price, availability, and rating. I combined this with Streamlit to make an interactive app that allows users to search for books by name, display results as a table, and download the results as a CSV file.

The scraper is very precise since it's based on exact class names and HTML tags. Yet, its precision is reliant upon the structure of the website not changingâ€”if the website alters the site structure or class names, I would have to reprogram the scraper. Currently, it's efficient and effective at the site structure it has been programmed for
